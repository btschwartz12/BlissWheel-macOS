# BlissWheel

### By: Ben Schwartz

BlissWheel is a macOS app that is designed to randomly display a yes or no to the screen. The app provides a simple interface for users to generate a random yes or no response. This project was created to showcase some graphics abilities in Swift. 

Although this is a simple project, please note that it was completed a while ago and may require some work to get running again. This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. 

To use BlissWheel, please clone the repository and run the app in Xcode. Since this project is incomplete, we cannot guarantee full functionality or support.
